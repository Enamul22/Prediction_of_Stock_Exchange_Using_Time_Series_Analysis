# Time Series Analysis on Stock Data

# Introduction
This project aims to analyze the historical stock data, identify its patterns, model its future values, and evaluate the model's accuracy. Time series analysis, particularly ARIMA modeling, was employed to achieve this.

# Data
The dataset used in this project represents the daily stock prices of a particular company (e.g., Apple) over a period. The primary focus was on the closing prices, which were transformed and cleaned to ensure accurate modeling.

Key Features:
Date: The day on which the stock data was recorded.
Close Price: The price of the stock at the end of the trading day.
Methods

# Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Visualized the stock data to identify patterns and anomalies.
Checked for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test.
Transformed the data using log and differencing to ensure stationarity.
Identified and managed outliers using box plots and capping methods.
Modeling:

Utilized the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, chosen for its efficacy in modeling time series data without seasonal patterns.
Employed the auto.arima() function to automatically select the best ARIMA parameters based on the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) value.
Forecasting & Evaluation:

Forecasted future stock prices using the trained ARIMA model.
Evaluated the model's accuracy using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

# Results & Discussion
The ARIMA model provided a point forecast along with 80% and 95% prediction intervals, giving an indication of the model's confidence in its predictions. The model achieved an RMSE of approximately 0.0062, indicating a fairly accurate prediction when compared to the actual test values.

While the model provided valuable insights into potential future stock prices, it's essential to consider the inherent unpredictability of stock markets influenced by myriad external factors.
